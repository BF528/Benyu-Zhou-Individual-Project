# Project Description

This project includes the programming and analyst part of Project 2, which replicates the in vivo part of the study of O'Meara, C.C. et al., Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate During Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration 1, to look at molecular roadblocks that could prevent regeneration in an adult mammalian heart. To be specific, genes that differentially expressed between the P0 (postnatal day 0) and Ad (Adult) stage was investigated in the project.
